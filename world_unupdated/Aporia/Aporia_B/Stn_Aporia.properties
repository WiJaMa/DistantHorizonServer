displayName=Aporia Hydrogen Harvesting, Inc.
splash.0=*ping* 9/10 star captains recommend Aporia Hydrogen - the smoothest, purest fuel in the verse! *ping*
splash.1=Aporia is a wandering gas giant far from any star. The darkness here is absolute.
splash.2=You've never seen a bar so well-stocked. The bartender seems to notice your shock. "You see anything else to do here?" she asks.
splash.3=As far as you're concerned, hydrogen is hydrogen, but racers all swear by Aporia. They say there's something special about it being harvested so far from any star.
splash.4=It's open mic night at the bar today. You had no idea there were so many ways to tell the same joke about hydrogen peroxide.
splash.5="They told me a stint on Aporia would be just the thing. I could get away from all of life's distractions and finally finish my novel. And, well, they were half right."
splash.6=Your 'Stowaway's Guide to the Stars' tells you never to play cards with Aporians, not that you needed the advice. You once saw a fellow trader break down in tears during a harrowing game of Mao.
splash.7="Heh. When I moved here I said I could never get tired of that night sky. But what I wouldn't give to get some real sun again!"
splash.8=Aporia Hydrogen Harvesting is owned by the Mavrellis, a wealthy family on Valadro. As far as you know, they've never set foot here.
splash.9=Aporia wasn't discovered until relatively recently,  and they still haven't finished exploring its moons. They say some of them are warm enough to sustain life below the surface.
splash.10=*ding* Anyone want to come up to the security room for some Gin Rummy? It's quiet as a graveyard today. *ding*
